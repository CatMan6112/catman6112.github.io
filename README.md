## WE ARE SO BACK

OG Cat-Nitro, or Pepsi Nitro was originally created by Dr Doomsday.

He created pepsi nitro, then **moved** the repository, in which he stoped updating it. 

I stepped in, rebranded it, and now commit (usually) weekly updates or quick bug fixes. Mr. Doomsday, was essentially banned off of github for having offensive pronouns.

This purged Pepsi Nitro, Leaving this website one of the only forks that remained standing. Most design and color pallet choice credit goes to him. However i have been addig more games and archives. 

Cat Nitro was taken offline temporarily due to my school blocking it. I was able to find a new provider in the games area, called "Nicolas AI" (yall should use it if github.io gets blocked). Anyways, I got it all set up, and: WE ARE BACK!
